# Student_database_C

Student Record Management System â€“ Project Description

This project is a console-based application built in C language.

It manages student records using a singly linked list data structure.

Each record includes a roll number, name, and percentage.

A unique roll number is auto-assigned to every new student.

The user can add, delete, modify, sort, search, and view records.

Records are inserted at the beginning of the linked list.

Deletion can be performed by roll number or name.

The program supports modifying data by searching roll no, name, or percentage.

The linked list allows dynamic memory allocation and flexible data handling.

The entire student list can be displayed in a formatted way.

Sorting options include roll number, name, and percentage (asc/desc).

Records can be reversed to change display order.

Users can delete all records at once, freeing memory.

A save option writes the data to student.txt for persistence.

File I/O is handled using standard C file functions.

The project uses ANSI color codes for better CLI experience.

It uses fgets() for safe string input to avoid overflow.

The project handles invalid and empty input cases gracefully.

Case-insensitive menu choices make it easy to use.

The program uses a static counter to manage roll numbers.

Bubble sort is used for sorting nodes via data swapping.

Reverse logic uses an array of pointers to swap links.

The program is easy to compile and run in any C environment.

It is ideal for students learning structures, pointers, and file handling in C.

The system is simple, modular, and extensible for future features.
